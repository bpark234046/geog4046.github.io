      <p>You are the Founder, President, and CEO of FFS Consulting, LLC. You received an email from a potential client who describes some requirements for a project. Find your own data to use as the client’s data, or choose from the examples below, and create the maps, apps, and web services to meet the client’s requirements.</p>

<strong>Subject</strong>: Web mapping project</p>

<p>Dear Sir or Madam,</p>

<p>I was referred to you for your web mapping services. My company has some data layers that we work with and share with clients. Currently, we do some analysis and stuff with ArcMap and then share the maps with clients as printouts or PDFs. We want to get something set up online, though, so we can send our clients links to web pages with maps on them instead of PDFs. Also, if possible, we want our analysts to be able to work on the data online instead of ArcMap. So I’m thinking we could have one web page for our internal use where our folks can analyze a dataset, and then a separate web page we share with clients where they can view layers with intuitive symbology. We want the clients to have some flexibility with how they use the online map, like filtering, querying, and summarizing the data, and maybe some additional visualizations like popups and charts. It would be great if they could even edit a layer themselves right there in the web map. I’m open to your input on what other kinds of bells and whistles could make the map better.</p>

<p>If that sounds like a project you’re interested in, could you send me your portfolio so I have some idea what to expect? Thanks in advance, and I look forward to seeing what’s possible with web GIS!</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Rusty Shackleford</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new ArcGIS Online trial account if your trial will expire soon, or use your class Portal account.</li>
  <li>Gather your data and, if necessary, add to “My Content” as a hosted feature layer.</li>
  <li>Create a map. This map can potentially be shared by both the “viewer” and “analysis” apps. Another option is to make two maps, one for each app.</li>
  <li>Configure symbology, popups, default view, etc.</li>
  <li>Share the map(s) and create the analysis app first with Web AppBuilder.</li>
  <li>Follow <a href="/assignments/book-assignment-07a/">Book 7a</a> to create the analysis app with the analysis widget.</li>
  <li>Create the viewer app with Web AppBuilder and add the required widgets and customizations.</li>
  <li>Update your portfolio to have at least four entries and make sure the HTML and CSS are valid with proper indentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="graded-requirements">Graded Requirements</h2>
<p>For quantities of layers, widgets, etc., consider the required numbers a minimum. You can always have additional layers and widgets.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>One</strong> ArcGIS Online web map</li>
  <li><strong>Two</strong> web apps (one “analysis app” and one “viewer app”)</li>
  <li>For the analysis app:<br />
a. Two tools in the analysis widget that will work with a layer (ch 7)<br />
b. One layer that will work with the two tools above (ch 7)<br />
c. Customizations to give the app a professional look and feel</li>
  <li>For the viewer app:<br />
a. <strong>Three</strong> data-dependent widgets (ch 5)<br />
b. <strong>Three</strong> other non-default widgets (ch 5)<br />
c. <strong>One</strong> layer that will work with the data-dependent widgets (ch 5)<br />
d. <strong>One</strong> layer added from the web (e.g., REST URL; see ch 6)<br />
e. <strong>One</strong> editable hosted feature layer (ch 3)<br />
f. Popup enabled on <strong>one</strong> layer with some kind of customization, such as changing the field alias (ch 2)<br />
g. Custom symbology on <strong>all</strong> layers where possible (ch 2)<br />
c. Customizations to give the app a professional look and feel</li>
  <li>For the portfolio:<br />
a. Valid HTML and CSS hosted online (JavaScript not required)<br />
b. At least four entries with a screenshot, link, and description<br />
c. Customizations such as a logo, font, or colors that distinguish your portfolio</li>
  <li>Take screenshot(s) of your analysis widget’s options before running the tools, and a screenshot of the output, such as a table or a new layer drawn on the map.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="submit-on-moodle">Submit on Moodle</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The URL of your analysis app</li>
  <li>The URL of your viewer app</li>
  <li>The URL of your portfolio</li>
  <li>Upload screenshots of the analysis widget’s options and output</li>
</ol>
