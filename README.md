# GEOG 4046 Web GIS

## General Statement
The purpose of this course is to give you hands-on experience creating websites with interactive maps combining geospatial data from various sources. The course introduces the technology behind the maps—web servers, geographic information system software, and data sources. The course will raise an awareness of these technologies’ capabilities and limitations, to build your capacity for decision making in fields that produce or consume web-based geospatial content.

By the end of this course, you should be able to create a website displaying interactive maps driven by geospatial data, and apply your knowledge to decision making in academic and professional fields.

## Prerequisites
Intermediate computer literacy

## Text 
The textbook is used for the ArcGIS Online portion of the course, and some assignments and test material come directly from the book.

### Quizzes
Brief quizzes will be given regularly to test comprehension of recent material. They will consist of a few questions or diagrams pulled straight from lecture materials. The questions will be on general concepts rather than specifics about the software used in assignments. Example: What is web GIS?

### Assignments
The course is taught in a lab where each student will have a computer workstation. A typical class period consists of a lecture mixed with hands-on exercises with software. The exercises teach skills that are applied to assignments given for each chapter or topic.

### Mid-term project
The mid-term project will pull together the technologies, methods, and skills learned up to that point to form a working website. There will be a set of core features that the site must have, defined in the project guidelines, but you have freedom to use different data and designs.

### Final project
The final project will employ all major concepts taught in the course in a web application serving, consuming, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. The application must satisfy the core requirements defined in the project guidelines, but students use their new-found decision making skills to choose the best technologies and methods to deliver a satisfactory product.

### Mid-term and final exams
The two exams will pull material from quizzes. They are meant to ensure that you leave the course not only proficient with web GIS software but conversant with web GIS concepts.

### Grading
The accumulated points at the end of the semester are divided by the total possible points for the final grade.

A-, A, A+	90-92, 92-98, 98-100  
B-, B, B+	80-82, 82-88, 88-90  
C-, C, C+	70-72, 72-78, 78-80  
D-, D, D+	60-62, 62-68, 68-70  
F		< 60

## Topic outline
**The technology of Web GIS**, such as web servers, web sites, and web services

**Using a Web GIS** with ArcGIS Online

**Building your own Web GIS** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Expectations outside of class
Assignments that cannot be completed during class will require you to finish the work in a campus computer lab, such as the Geography and Anthropology GIS lab in Howe-Russell E220, or acquire the requisite software for use on their personal computer. Time spent on an assignment outside of class might be expected to mirror time spent on the related topics in class, including the lectures and exercises.
