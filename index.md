## Syllabus
The purpose of this course is to give you hands-on experience creating websites with interactive maps combining spatial data from various sources. The course introduces the technology behind the maps--geographic information systems, server software, data sources, and web development languages. The course will raise an awareness of these technologies' capabilities and limitations, to build your capacity for decision making in fields that produce or consume web-based maps.

By the end of this course, you should be able to create a website displaying interactive maps driven by geospatial data, and apply your knowledge in academic and professional fields.

The course is taught in a computer lab, [260 Howe-Russell](http://ga.lsu.edu/computer-labs).

## Topics
**The technology of Web GIS**, such as web servers, web sites, and web services

**Using a Web GIS** with ArcGIS Online

**Building your own Web GIS** with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Prerequisites
While there are no prerequisite courses, you must be computer literate to take this course. You should be familiar with common tasks such as using a web browser; downloading, opening, zipping, renaming, and copying files and folders; editing documents and spreadsheets with a text editor or Excel; and navigating to files in Windows.

Having experience with GIS and programming would be an advantage, but is not assumed.

## Book
The textbook is used for the ArcGIS Online portion of the course, and some assignments and test material come directly from the book:

Fu, Pinde. *Getting to Know Web GIS: Second Edition*. Redlands: ESRI Press, 2016

For corrections and sample data, see the [book resources](http://esripress.esri.com/bookResources/index.cfm?event=catalog.book&amp;id=27).

## Evaluation

Quizzes | 10%
Assignments | 30%
Mid-term project | 15%
Mid-term exam | 15%
Final project | 15%
Final exam | 15%

#### Quizzes
Brief quizzes will be given regularly to test comprehension of recent material. They will consist of a few questions or diagrams pulled straight from lecture materials.

#### Assignments
Assignments are based on lectures and exercises covered in class, and include tasks such as building maps in ArcGIS Online and creating web pages. They typically need to be completed outside of class.

#### Mid-term project
The mid-term project will pull together the technologies and skills learned up to that point to form a working website. There will be a set of core features that the site must have, defined in the project guidelines, but you have freedom to use different data and designs.

#### Final project
The final project will employ all major concepts taught in the course in a web application serving, consuming, analyzing, and visualizing spatial data. The application must satisfy the core requirements defined in the project guidelines, but students use their new-found decision making skills to choose the best technologies and methods to deliver a satisfactory product.

#### Mid-term and final exams
The two exams will pull material from quizzes. They are meant to ensure that you leave the course not only proficient with web GIS software but conversant with web GIS concepts.

#### Grading
The total points you've earned by the end of the semester will be divided by the total possible points for your final grade (%).

grade	| minus	| no sign |	plus
----- | ----- | ------- | ----
A	| 90-92 |	92-98 |	98-100
B	| 80-82	| 82-88	| 88-90
C	| 70-72 |	72-78	| 78-80
D	| 60-62 |	62-68	| 68-70
F	| | < 60		

#### Late submissions
Assignments and projects not submitted by the deadlines will lose a letter grade at the start of subsequent class periods while the paper is delinquent. Assignments, quizzes, exams, and projects not completed by grade submission deadlines (midterm and final) might result in an Incomplete grade in the course. Home computer and Internet troubles will not be acceptable excuses for late submissions.

## Expectations outside of class
Assignments that cannot be completed during class will require you to finish the work on your own computer or in a campus computer lab, such as the Geography and Anthropology GIS lab in [Howe-Russell E220](http://ga.lsu.edu/computer-labs). Time spent on an assignment outside of class might be expected to mirror the time spent on the related topics in class, including the lectures and exercises.
